# 🏥 Hospital Resource Utilization & Patient Outcomes Dashboard
![Executive Overview](dashboards.png)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Power BI dashboard** built to analyze and optimize hospital resource utilization and patient outcomes across a multi-specialty hospital network.  
It helps hospital administrators and operations teams make **data-driven decisions** related to staffing, bed management, cost control, and patient care quality.

The dashboard is designed to be **simple, interpretable, and non-technical user friendly**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Hospitals often face challenges such as:
- Bed shortages during peak hours
- Uneven doctor workloads
- Delayed patient discharges
- High readmission rates
- Difficulty comparing performance across departments and branches

This project addresses these challenges by providing **clear KPIs, trends, and comparisons** using real-world hospital metrics.
